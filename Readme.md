# Web App Boilerplate using FastAPI, Vue.js and Vuetify

Utilizing the framework of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) as the UI library can boost up the development of a web application in 2020. This repository provides the starter boilerplate to combine those frameworks. The SQLite is the standard choice which can be changed in [database.py](.database.py).

## Testing the API using Insomnia Core

The tool can be download in https://insomnia.rest/download/. Below is an example to update the profile entry in the database.

```
{
	"id":"hj2t4fz",
